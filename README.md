# MergeMultipleCSVFiles
You can use this Python script to merge as many CSV files you want together.

It was made using the pandas and os modules.

All you have to do is place the python file inside the folder with CSV files, replace the placeholder "FILE_PATH" with the file path where all csv files are and run the Python script. A a new "merged_csv.csv" file will be created with all CSV files combined.
